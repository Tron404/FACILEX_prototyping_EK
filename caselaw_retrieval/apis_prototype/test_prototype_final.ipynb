The countries involved in the cooperation procedure are Italy and Croatia. The requested person filed a constitutional complaint against the court decisions ordering pre-trial detention in the surrender proceedings because the court did not explain 1) the existence of reasonable suspicion as a general prerequisite for ordering pre-trial detention for the purpose of surrender, as well as 2) the circumstances from which the risk of escape arises, which led to the pre-trial detention.</span></p><p class=\"ql-align-justify\"><span style=\"color: rgb(72, 72, 72);\">1) The Constitutional Court assesses that, in accordance with the relevant jurisprudence of the Supreme Court, reasonable suspicion should not be established when deciding on pretrial detention in the process of handing over a wanted person. When it comes to the deprivation of liberty due to extradition, the Constitutional Court points out that Article 5, paragraph 1, point f) of the Convention (ECHR) does not require that the detention of a person against whom actions have been taken with the aim of extradition is reasonably considered necessary, for example, in order to prevent to commit a crime or escape. In this regard, Article 5 paragraph 1 point f) provides a different level of protection than that in Article 5 paragraph 1 point c) of the Convention. Article 5, paragraph 1, point f) requires that \"actions are taken for the purpose of deportation\". Therefore, it is irrelevant in terms of Article 5, paragraph 1, point f) whether the main decision on expulsion can be justified on the basis of national or convention law (see U-III-351/2014 and U-III-3150/2018 and judgments Chahal v. United Kingdom, No. 22414/93, § 112 of 15 November 1996 and Amie and others v.
