They alleged that they did not have an ability to pay the fines due to their financial circumstances and that the city did not consider their ability to pay. On May 1, 2014, the District Court granted the plaintiffs motion for a preliminary injunction, preventing the city from collecting more money from traffic tickets of plaintiffs'. On October 31, 2014 the parties filed to dismiss the case pursuant to a settlement agreement, which included numerous changes to Municipal Court proceedings. The case is now closed.\""

       " \"In July 2010, California’s Office of the Inspector General\\n\\n11 (OIG) issued a Special Report on BPH’s Psychological Evaluations, in which the OIG\\n\\n12 determined that BPH has no system for tracking or otherwise monitoring the number of errors\\n\\n13 in psychological evaluations, no system for determining whether FAD psychologists are\\n\\n14 assessing higher levels of risk than were found in previous evaluations of the same prisoners,\\n\\n15 an inadequate oversight system for senior FAD psychologists to review the reports of FAD\\n\\n16 staff psychologists, and inadequate training of its psychologists.In summary, the BPH hired its own team of FAD psychologists to prepare\\n\\n14 evaluations because those prepared by prison-based clinicians were too favorable to prisoners\\n\\n15 and too often supported judicial rejection of BPH decisions; they did this after admitting that\\n\\n16 the evaluations themselves were unnecessary and being misused; they ordered their new FAD\\n\\n17 team to utilize risk assessment tools their own experts said were invalid and unjustifiably\\n\\n18 produce elevated assessments; they ordered their FAD team to assess insight and remorse\\n\\n19 immediately after admitting that these clinicians are distinctly incapable of assessing such\\n\\n20 matters; and these evaluations are cited for their elevated risk assessments and their\\n\\n21 assessments of insight and remorse every time parole is denied.\\n\\nHere, a recording or\\n\\n27 transcript of Plaintiff’s meeting with Dr. Hayward would reveal whether or not there was\\n\\n28\\n\\n16\\nCivil Complaint for Declaratory and Injunctive Relief Johnson v.

2 & 14) defendants made numerous false and misleading statements to the public 9 and other state agencies regarding the process of establishing the FAD and selecting the risk 10 assessment tools; 3) defendants refused to remove errors from plaintiff’s psychological 11 assessment; 4) while plaintiff was provided with the psychological assessment, he was not 12 provided with the raw data of the assessment or a recording or transcript of the interview; 5) 13 plaintiff was unable to be heard at the hearing because he did not have the raw data underlying 14 the assessment; 6) defendants refuse to record or transcribe the psychological interviews; 7) there 15 are no standards used by the FAD in distinguishing between the various risk categories (low, 16 moderate, or high), thus there is a lack of consistency; 8) while defendants allow plaintiff and 17 other prisoners to file objections to their assessments, the objections are frequently not provided 18 to the BPH; 9) plaintiff and other prisoners are not permitted to question or meet with FAD 19 psychologists after the reports haven been written; 10) defendants routinely overlook or discount 20 errors or omissions contained in the assessments; 11) the BPH grants parole to less than 1% of 21 prisoners appearing at their first hearings; 12 & 13) defendants deny plaintiff and other prisoners 22 the ability to call witnesses, including adverse witnesses such as the FAD psychologists at their 23 parole hearings; 15) defendants failed to comply with the requirements of California’s 24 Administrative Procedures Act is setting up the FAD; 16) defendants have never or almost never 25 had FAD psychologists testify at parole hearings in violation of California law.9\\n\\nSection 42 §1983 does contain a provision abrogating Pulliam in part:\\n\\n10\\n\\n“Every person who, under color of any statute, ordinance,\\n\\nregulation, custom, or usage, of any State or Territory or the\\n\\n11\\n\\nDistrict of Columbia, subjects, or causes to be subjected, any\\n\\ncitizen of the United States or other person within the jurisdiction\\n\\n12\\n\\nthereof to the deprivation of any rights, privileges, or immunities\\n\\nsecured by the Constitution and laws, shall be liable to the party\\n\\n13\\n\\ninjured in an action at law, suit in equity, or other proper\\n\\nproceeding for redress, except that in any action brought against a\\n\\n14\\n\\njudicial officer for an act or omission taken in such officer's\\n\\njudicial capacity, injunctive relief shall not be granted unless a\\n\\n15\\n\\ndeclaratory decree was violated or declaratory relief was\\n\\nunavailable.16\\n\\nNo. 2:12-cv-1059 KJM AC P ORDER\\n\\n17\\n\\n18\\n\\nPlaintiffs are a class of state prisoners represented by named plaintiff Sam Johnson\\n\\n19 proceeding through counsel with this civil rights action seeking relief under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.\\n\\nDefendants have\\n\\n25 filed objections to the findings and recommendations and plaintiffs have filed a reply to\\n\\n26 /////\\n\\n27 1A Final Fairness Hearing shall take place at 10:00 a.m. on December 18, 2015 at\\n\\n13 the United States District Court for the Eastern District of California, United States Courthouse,\\n\\n14 501 I St., Sacramento CA 95814, in Courtroom 3, to determine whether the proposed settlement\\n\\n15 of this action on the terms and conditions provided for in the Stipulated Settlement is fair,\\n\\n16 reasonable, and adequate and should be finally approved by the court, and whether this action\\n\\n17 should be dismissed under the settlement.Under Federal Rule of Civil Procedure 23(e)(1), the court approves the substance,\\n\\n28 form and manner of the Notice of Proposed Class Action Settlement (the “Notice”) filed by the 2\\nOrder Granting Prelim.the strength of the plaintiffs’ case;

Story.Doraville’s institutional reliance on revenue from fines, fees, and forfeitures creates a bias or an appearance of bias that results in a lack of due process of law in the trial of defendants charged by the Doraville city government.\\nAt Doraville Municipal Court hearings, the Doraville City Attorney acts as the criminal prosecutor.\\nThat doctrine\\n11\\nAO 72A (Rev.8/82)\\n\\n\\x0cCase 1:18-cv-02375-RWS Document 30 Filed 04/01/19 Page 12 of 21\\nembodies the reality that federal district courts do not have jurisdiction to act as appellate courts, and thereby precludes district courts from reviewing final state court decisions.The Court disagrees and finds that Plaintiffs have sufficiently alleged\\n7\\nAO 72A (Rev.8/82)\\n\\n\\x0cCase 1:18-cv-02375-RWS Document 30 Filed 04/01/19 Page 8 of 21\\nstanding under Article III.All things considered, then, the Court the finds that (based on the allegations in the Complaint) the City and its municipal court depend heavily on fines and fees revenue, and Doraville’s municipal court judges have a strong enough motive to maximize those revenue to warrant a reasonable fear of partisan influence in decisions related to ordinance violations and the assessing of criminal penalties.That is, the City’s police department and City Attorney’s office, like the municipal court, are dependent on revenues from fines, fees, and forfeitures, and Doraville’s law enforcement personnel, much like its municipal court judges, are subject to the partisan influences of its City Council which is free to de-fund those offices, should it choose.\",\n",

Nicholas for presentment of motion for extension of time to file response/reply 96 before Honorable Virginia M. Kendall on 12/6/2018 at 09:00 AM.There are questions of law and fact common to all class members, including but not limited to the following:\\n• Does a statutory scheme that results in the extrajudicial imposition of life imprisonment violate the Eighth and Fourteenth Amendments;\\n• Does a statutory scheme that deprives individuals of their liberty solely because of their inability to afford housing violate the Equal Protection Clause;\\n• Are Illinois statutes regulating where individuals deemed sex offenders may reside while on MSR void for vagueness because they fail to define what is meant by many of their operative terms and thus fail to give sufficient guidance to IDOC officials and to prisoners seeking compliant housing\\n124.The named Plaintiffs seek to represent two classes consisting of the following:\\n• Class One: All individuals who have received an MSR sentence of three years to life currently detained in the Illinois Department of Corrections who have been approved for release on MSR by the PRB but have been denied release from IDOC custody because of their inability to find an approved host site; and\\n• Class Two: All individuals who have received an MSR sentence of three years to life currently or in the future detained in the Illinois Department of Corrections who will in the future remain detained indefinitely in prison due to the unavailability of host sites.\\nAs a result, when the Plaintiffs filed their Motion for Class Certification and Appointment of Class Counsel they sought only to certify a\\n\\n\\x0cCase: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 63 Filed: 04/06/18 Page 2 of 2 PageID #:328\\nclass of “all individuals sentenced to serve ‘three-years-to-life’ on MSR currently detained in the Illinois Department of Corrections (“IDOC”) who have been approved for release on MSR by the PRB but have been denied release from IDOC custody because of their inability to obtain an approved host site.”Plaintiffs Paul Murphy, Stanley Meyer, J.D. Lindenmeyer, and Jasen Gustafsen are putative class representatives who sued Defendants Lisa Madigan and John Baldwin, in their official capacities, seeking declaratory and injunctive relief for alleged Eighth and Fourteenth Amendment civil rights violations under 42 U.S.C. § 1983.Id. at *2; see also, e.g., U.S. v. Charmichael, 343 F.3d 756, 761–762 (5th Cir. 2003) (plaintiffs’ challenge to the constitutionality of DNA sampling during supervised release not ripe because plaintiffs had not yet been released); see also, e.g., Themeus v. ICE, No. 15 C 39, 2015 WL 3952708 (N.D. Fla June 29, 2015) (challenge to future ICE detention not ripe because plaintiff was still in prison and therefore the removal period had not begun); see also, e.g., Israel v. Dr. Worral, et al., No. 14 C 158, 2014 WL 7212958 (D. Alaska December 17, 2014) (plaintiff’s § 1983 claim based on a future discretionary parole was not ripe while he was still in prison); see also, e.g., Abreu v. Ayers, No. 98-3099, 1998 WL 544968 (N.D. Cal.Instead, Plaintiffs allege that the procedure for determining housing is unconstitutional and, like Edwards’ claim for injunctive relief, that claim is properly brought under § 1983.2 Should Plaintiffs prevail, some of the Plaintiffs may, hypothetically, be released on MSR because under constitutional procedures because the Defendants may be more likely approve proposed host sites.The Court accordingly grants the plaintiffs’ motion for summary judgment (Dkt. 75) as to their equal protection (Count II) and Eighth Amendment claims (Count IV), denies it as to their substantive (Count I) and procedural (Count III) due process claims, and denies the defendants’ cross-motion in full (Dkt. 88).Case: 1:16-cv-11471 Document #: 132 Filed: 03/31/19 Page 1 of 61 PageID #:1506\\n\\nIN THE UNITED STATES DISTRICT COURT NORTHERN DISTRICT OF ILLINOIS EASTERN DIVISION\\n\\nPAUL MURHY et al., Plaintiffs,\\nv.

Class Ce rtification Unde r Rule 23 Class actions permit representative plaintiffs to litigate their claims on behalf of members\\nof the class not before the court.Plaintiffs stress that Defendants’ alleged practice of conditioning pretrial release on the payment of cash bail without questioning an individual’s ability to pay affects all proposed class members in the exact same fashion, such that a declaration “setting forth, as this Court did in Caliste, the basic substantive and procedural requirements for an order of pretrial detention would equally benefit every member of the class.”Whether Defendants have a policy and practice of refusing to conduct an inquiry into ability to pay prior to requiring secured financial conditions of release;\\n• Whether Defendants have a policy and practice of routinely refusing to consider non-financial conditions of release in many cases;\\n• Whether Defendants require secured financial conditions of release without making any findings that those conditions are the least restrictive condition necessary to mitigate any particular risks identified;\\n• Whether Defendants require de facto orders of pretrial detention based on unattainable secured financial conditions of release without applying any applicable legal or evidentiary standard, let alone by clear and convincing evidence;\\n• Whether Defendant Judges exercise control over the expenditure of funds generated through the 1.8% fee on commercial surety bonds they set;\\n• Whether the funds generated from the fee on commercial surety bonds are significant such that they would provide a possible temptation to the average man\\n15\\n\\n\\x0cCase 2:19-cv-13553-EEF-MBN Document 14 Megan Stevenson, Distortion of Justice: How the Inability to Pay Bail Affects Case Outcomes 18 (May 2, 2016), available at https://www.law.upenn.edu/cf/faculty/research/details.cfm?research_id=14047; Arpit Gupta, et al., The Heavy Costs of High Bail: Evidence from Judge Randomization 45 J.

Part 121; and demonstrate that the desired credit is not available elsewhere on reasonable terms, 15 U.S.C. § 632(h); 13 C.F.R. §§ 120.100(e), 120.101.\\nThe defendants dispute this, stating that they have sent a notification of the updated rule to “18 national trade associations for all types of lenders, large individual lenders, and most new non-bank lenders; SBA field staff and senior headquarters staff; external affairs officials at the Federal Reserve, FDIC, OCC, NCUA, Treasury, the SEC, and USDA, who actively engage with multiple lender communities; the Minority Business Development Agency at the Department of Commerce; State bank supervisors; and major business groups, religious organizations and nonprofit council groups.”The plaintiffs request that the deadline for PPP applications be extended from June 30, 2020, until July 21, 2020, to account for the fact that owners of many now-eligible businesses do not know they are eligible; the SBA has not publicized the new June 24 rule;19 many lenders are no longer accepting applications in anticipation of the June 30 deadline; and many lenders are still using old forms.Intervention from this Court is the only way to give those whom Defendants have wrongfully excluded from relief—as well as the banks that stopped accepting applications solely because of the impending deadline—an interval even remotely close to the three-month window Congress promised all eligible applicants.4\\n4 Given that over $125 billion in PPP funds remain available, there is a less urgent need for the Court to enjoin the agency to set aside funds for these wrongfully excluded applicants, as the Defendants explained at the scheduling hearing in this matter on June 18, 2020.Page 6 of 27\\nPRELIMINARY STATEMENT On June 24, 2020—that is, yesterday—less than a week before the expiration of the deadline for small businesses to apply for Paycheck Protection Program (“PPP”) funds, the Small Business Administration (“SBA”) issued a new rule that significantly narrowed the scope of its criminal-record exclusions.Tel.: (202) 639-6000 Fax: (202) 639-6066 KBracey@Jenner.com EDeutsch@Jenner.com\\nJacob D.

       " 'When impoverished people appear in the courtroom and City payment window, they are told by the judge, courtroom officers, City prosecutor, and City clerk that they will be jailed if they do not bring specific sums of money to the City on designated dates in the future.\\nNot only does the City place indigent people on generic and overly onerous payment plans lasting years or decades when the cases of wealthier people would be terminated, but by imposing imprisonment, repeated threats of imprisonment, indeterminate “payment dockets” for many years, extra and invalid fees and surcharges, and other restrictions on Plaintiffs, the City takes advantage of its control over the machinery of the City jail and police systems to deny debtors the procedural and substantive statutory protections that every other Missouri debtor may invoke against a private creditor.Nevertheless, at this early stage, the Court finds that Plaintiffs’ allegations of repeated detentions lasting days, weeks, and in one case, nearly two months, during which Plaintiffs allege they were forced to sleep on the floor in dirty cells with blood, mucus, and feces; were denied basic hygiene and feminine hygiene products; were denied access to shower, laundry, and clean undergarments for several days at a time; were denied medications; and were provided little or inadequate food and water, are sufficient to state a plausible claim for a due process violation attributable to the City.\\n29\\n\\n\\x0cof clothes, running water, hygiene supplies, blanket, and mattress for four days did not violate Eighth Amendment), Whitnack, 16 F.3d at 958 (finding no constitutional violation arising from dirty cell with excrement and vomit because conditions lasted only for 24 hours before cleaning supplies were distributed), and Stickley, 703 F.3d at 423-24 (finding denial of pretrial detainee’s requests for additional toilet paper did not violate constitution because of the limited amount of time he went without toilet paper and because “[w]hen he did run out of toilet paper, he was able to clean himself by taking a shower”), with Owens, 328 F.3d at 1027 (finding question of fact raised regarding due process violation where pretrial detainee spent five weeks sleeping on mattress on floor approximately a foot and a half away from toilet, where urine splashed on blankets and blankets were cleaned less than once a month), and Morris, 601 F.3d at 811 (holding that transporting pretrial detainee “in a small, unsanitary dog cage for [a] ninety-minute drive” to the courthouse, “with no compelling urgency and other options available, was excessive in relation to the goal of preventing escape, and thus, an inference may be reasonably made that [this] conduct amounted to [unconstitutional] punishment”).\\nWith respect to Count Six, Plaintiffs argue that they have stated a valid Fourth Amendment claim, notwithstanding their facially valid arrest warrants, based on the City’s alleged policy of issuing arrest warrants without probable cause.\\nThe City also argues that Plaintiffs’ Fourth Amendment claim in Count Six was correctly dismissed because Plaintiffs’ allegations were based on signed and issued warrants, and any argument about the underlying probable cause for those warrants was not adequately pleaded in the complaint.\\n4\\n\\n\\x0cDISCUSSION A “district court has the inherent power to reconsider and modify an interlocutory order any time prior to the entry of judgment.”Page: 48 of 59 PageID #: 486\\n• Whether the initial amount of money required by the City for release is predetermined and/or set without reference to a person’s ability to pay;\\n• Whether the City has a policy and practice of failing to conduct meaningful inquiries into the ability of a person to pay before keeping the person in jail for non-payment;\\n• Whether the City provides notice to debtors that their ability to pay will be a relevant issue at the proceedings at which they are jailed or kept in jail and whether the City makes findings concerning ability to pay and alternatives to incarceration;\\n• Whether the City provides adequate legal representation to those jailed for non-payment in proceedings that result in their incarceration;\\n• Whether the City jail conditions are and have been unsanitary, unsafe, and inhumane in the ways described in this Complaint;\\n• Whether City employees and agents have a policy and practice of threatening debtors and families of debtors with incarceration for unpaid debts without informing them of their rights;\\n• Whether the City has a policy of issuing and executing warrants for the arrest of debtors despite lacking probable cause that they have committed any offense and without any notice or opportunity to be heard concerning their ability to pay or the validity of the debt;\\n• Whether the City has a policy and practice of failing to make prompt neutral probable cause findings based on sworn evidence for warrantless arrests.\\nThe efforts of Plaintiffs’ counsel have so far included extensive investigation over\\na period of months, including numerous interviews with witnesses, City employees, City jail inmates, families, attorneys practicing in the Ferguson Municipal Court, community members, statewide experts in the functioning of Missouri municipal courts, and national experts in constitutional law, debt collection, bankruptcy law, criminal law, and jails.\\nPark v.

Resentencing Efforts In early 2007, DOCS — at Annucci’s order as authorized by Fischer\\n— began to review inmate files to identify those whose sentence and commitment orders did not indicate PRS, but who nevertheless had PRS added to their sentences.29 Over four to six weeks, DOCS created a database to indicate whether PRS was indicated on the commitment order, and kept this database updated as new inmates entered DOCS’s custody.30 DOCS identified approximately 8,100 individuals whose sentence and commitment orders were silent regarding PRS but whose terms of PRS had been calculated and added by DOCS.31\\nIn April 2008, the New York Court of Appeals decided Garner v. New\\n27 See Pl.Defendants in Earley had argued that section 70.45 mandated a period of PRS and therefore was necessarily a part of the sentence — that is, any sentence without a term of PRS was illegal.14 The Second Circuit disagreed that the term of PRS was automatic, and stated that, rather than administratively imposing PRS, New York law provided a remedy to correct any “illegal sentence[:] the state may move to have the offending sentence vacated and the defendant resentenced by a judge,” consistent with New York Criminal Procedure Law Section 440.40.15\\nB.

Trauger\\n\\nMEMORANDUM\\n\\nThe Nashville Community Bail Fund (“NCBF”) has filed a Motion for Preliminary\\n\\nInjunction (Docket No. 3), to which Howard Gentry, in his official capacity as Criminal Court\\n\\nClerk for the Twentieth Judicial District, has filed a Response (Docket No. 15), and NCBF has\\n\\nfiled a Reply (Docket No. 16).The Twentieth Judicial District’s system, as it currently exists, functions like this: a court sets what it determines is an appropriate dollar figure to be posted as bail to secure the defendant’s release; that dollar figure is communicated to the Clerk, whose job it is to take and look after the money; but, then, when NCBF comes to post bail, it is required to surrender not merely the dollar figure determined by the court, but also an additional, valuable asset—the consent to garnishment—that was not included in any calculation of what was necessary to ensure the defendant’s appearance in court.For its first cause of action, NCBF alleges that, “[t]hrough enforcement of Rule 10(B) and his own garnishment policy, [the Clerk] violates the Eighth Amendment rights of all accused persons in the Nashville Criminal Courts” by subjecting those defendants to a monetary bail condition—consent to and liability for potential future garnishment—over and above what was calculated as necessary to serve the constitutionally permissible purposes of bail.Multiple federal courts, including the Fifth Circuit Court\\nof Appeals, have recognized the validity of these research findings,19 and further\\n17 Michael Jones, Ph.D., Unsecured Bonds: The As Effective and Most Efficient Pretrial Release Option (Oct. 2013), https://cutt.ly/Se3WGqK (controlling for risk level and finding that persons released on unsecured bonds performed as well as those released on secured bonds in terms of court appearance rates); Brooker, Claire M.

       " \"Due to DSS’s drastic shortage of foster care placements, especially foster homes, DSS exposes Plaintiff Children to specific harms, including: unnecessarily institutionalizing children in foster care, especially young children, for extended periods of time; denying community-based placements and services that meet the treatment needs of children in foster care with emotional, behavioral or psychological disabilities; repeatedly moving children from one inappropriate home or facility to another; separating children in foster care from their siblings and interfering with those family relationships; placing children on a reunification track at great distances from their biological parents and interfering with those family relationships; and unnecessarily housing children in foster care in juvenile justice detention facilities awaiting a hearing or determination on their charge or beyond their sentence or plea specifically because DSS has nowhere else to house them.\\nIn contrast to the 2008 Governor’s Task Force recommendation that DSS maintain at least the same number of foster homes as the number of children in foster care, in June 2013, the number of licensed regular foster homes per child needing regular foster care placement in South Carolina was 0.8 – a shortage that only continued to grow.J.

United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471 (1999) and its companion cases that whether an impairment substantially limits a major life activity is to be determined with reference to the ameliorative effects of mitigating measures; (3) to reject the Supreme Court\\'s reasoning in Sutton v. United Air Lines, Inc., 527 U.S. 471 (1999)with regard to coverage under the third prong of the definition of disability and to reinstate the reasoning of the Supreme Court in School Board of Nassau County v. Arline, 480 U.S. 273 (1987) which set forth a broad view of the third prong of the definition of handicap under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973; (4) to reject the standards enunciated by the Supreme Court in Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002), that the terms ‗substantially‘ and ‗major‘ in the definition of disability under the ADA ‗need to be interpreted strictly to create a demanding standard for qualifying as disabled,‘ and that to be substantially limited in performing a major life activity under the ADA ‗an individual must have an impairment that prevents or severely restricts the individual from doing activities that are of central importance to most people‘s daily lives‘; (5) to convey congressional intent that the standard created by the Supreme Court in the case of Toyota Motor Manufacturing, Kentucky, Inc. v. Williams, 534 U.S. 184 (2002) for ‗substantially limits‖, and applied by lower courts in numerous decisions, has created an inappropriately high level of limitation necessary to obtain coverage under the ADA, to convey that it is the intent of Congress that the primary object of attention in cases brought under the ADA should be whether entities covered under the ADA have complied with their obligations, and to convey that the question of whether an individual‘s impairment is a disability under the ADA should not demand extensive analysis.‖ 42 U.S.C.A. §12101 (Findings and Purposes) Pub.The DFEH has adequately pled its second cause of action\\n\\n11 for flagging, and the motion to dismiss this claim should be denied.\\n\\n12\\n\\nF.

DefendantThrough the acts and omissions described herein, Defendants’ failure to provide the proper supports and services in the most integrated setting, resulting in unnecessary segregation of students with disabilities into Staten Island District 75 placements and denial of equal educational opportunities to these students, violates Title II of the ADA by:\\ni) Denying the Named Plaintiffs and Class Members the opportunity to participate in and benefit from educational services and opportunities that are equal to those afforded other students;\\nii) Denying the Named Plaintiffs and Plaintiff Class Members services that are as effective in affording equal opportunity to obtain the same result, gain the same benefit, or reach the same level of achievement as that provided other students;\\niii) Denying the Named Plaintiffs and Plaintiff Class Members the opportunity to receive educational programs and services in the most integrated setting appropriate to their needs, which is defined as “a setting that enables individuals with disabilities to interact with nondisabled persons to the fullest extent possible,” 28 C.F.R. pt. 35, App.Through their policies, procedures, and practices relating to their administration of Staten Island School District 75, Defendants fail to meet their obligations under IDEA and state implementing regulations including, but not limited to: i) Defendants do not provide FAPE in the LRE to the individual Named Plaintiffs and Class Members with disabilities because they do not ensure that appropriate services\\n39\\n\\n\\x0cand supports are available for students with disabilities in their community schools; and ii) Defendants’ creation and administration of a segregated school district, ensuring that students with disabilities are isolated from their non-disabled peers for the entire school day, violates their obligation to ensure that Staten Island District 75 students are educated in the LRE. 278.',\n",

       " 'to ignore a state\\'s Eleventh i\\\\mendment immunity and impose prospective injunctive relief on state officials to enjoin a future violation of federal law); see also Missouri v. Jenkins, 491 U.S. 274,279 (1989) (stating that a state\\'s Eleventh Amendment immunity does not prevent \"an award of attorney\\'s fees ancilIal)\\' to a grant of prospective relief\\' pursued under Ex parte Young).7\\nFurthermore, even if Ex parte Young did not apply, the Bradleys could pursue any remedies available under the IDEA against Crowley because, when Arkansas waived its own Eleventh Amendment immunity with respect to IDEA claims, it also\\nw.aived any Eleventh Amendment immunity Crowley might have had as a state official\\nwith respect to such claims.Jun. 14, 1999), we allowed private citizens\\' claims that the ADE had violated the IDEA to proceed in federal court on two independent grounds, either of which was a sufficient basis for rejecting the lWE\\'s claim of Eleventh Amendment immunity: (1) that the IDEA abrogated the states\\' immunity and that the abrogation was effective because Congress exercised its power under § 5 of the Fourteenth Amendment when enacting the IDEA; and (2) that Congress created a valid spending program when it enacted the IDEA, and that Arkansas waived its immunity when it participated in IDEA programs, accepting funds appropriated pursuant to the IDEA and governed by the conditions imposed by the IDEA.The class, as defined by Plaintiffs, includes:\\nAll high school, junior high school, middle school, or late primary school-age children, as well their parents, guardians and next friends who have been identified as having autism, Asperger\\'s Syndrome, or Pervasive Developmental Disorder (PDD), or a disability with characteristics similar to autism, and who have strong cognitive abilities, but who have been, are being or will be denied an education which\\n(a) is both appropriate and integrated, as to both academic and extracurricular activities;\\n(b) provides for participation and progress in the general curriculum;

(2) State Defendants failed to provide an appropriate, integrated education to David which meets the state\\'s own standards, including participation and progress in the general\\n\\n1\\n\\ncurriculum;

The parties filed to dismiss the case on October 31, 2014, pursuant to a settlement agreement.
