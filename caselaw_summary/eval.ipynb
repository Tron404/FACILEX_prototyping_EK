In the amended complaint, petitioners alleged that the imprisonment orders violated their Sixth and Fourteenth Amendment Rights. Petitioners sought remedy through injunctive and declaratory relief. In 2014, the parties reached a settlement that provided new judicial procedures for the Municipal Court to follow regarding indigent defendants and nonpayment. It also included three declarations, most importantly, it declared that the constitutional principles set out in Bearden v. Georgia, 461 U.S. 660 (1983), and Turner v. Rogers, 131 S. Ct. 2507 (2011) applied to municipal court proceedings, and awarded plaintiff's attorney fees. The case closed in November 2014. \""
