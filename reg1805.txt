CHAPTER II

TRANSMISSION, RECOGNITION AND EXECUTION OF FREEZING ORDERS

Article 4

Transmission of freezing orders

1.   A freezing order shall be transmitted by means of a freezing certificate. The issuing authority shall transmit the freezing certificate provided for in Article 6 directly to the executing authority or, where applicable, to the central authority referred to in Article 24(2), by any means capable of producing a written record under conditions that allow the executing authority to establish the authenticity of the freezing certificate.

2.   Member States may make a declaration stating that, when a freezing certificate is transmitted to them with a view to the recognition and execution of a freezing order, the issuing authority is to transmit the original freezing order or a certified copy thereof together with the freezing certificate. However, only the freezing certificate has to be translated, in accordance with Article 6(2).

3.   Member States may make the declaration referred to in paragraph 2 prior to the date of application of this Regulation or at a later date. Member States may withdraw such a declaration at any time. Member States shall inform the Commission when they make or withdraw such a declaration. The Commission shall make such information available to all Member States and to the EJN.

4.   As regards a freezing order concerning an amount of money, where the issuing authority has reasonable grounds to believe that the person against whom the freezing order was issued has property or income in a Member State, it shall transmit the freezing certificate to that Member State.

5.   As regards a freezing order concerning specific items of property, where the issuing authority has reasonable grounds to believe that such items are located in a Member State, it shall transmit the freezing certificate to that Member State.

6.   The freezing certificate shall:

(a)


be accompanied by a confiscation certificate transmitted in accordance with Article 14; or

(b)


contain an instruction that the property is to remain frozen in the executing State pending the transmission and execution of the confiscation order in accordance with Article 14, in which case the issuing authority shall indicate the estimated date of this transmission in the freezing certificate.

7.   The issuing authority shall inform the executing authority if it is aware of any affected persons. The issuing authority shall also provide, upon request, the executing authority with any information relevant to any claim that such affected persons may have in relation to the property, including any information identifying those persons.

8.   Where, despite the information having been made available in accordance with Article 24(3), the competent executing authority is unknown to the issuing authority, the issuing authority shall make all necessary inquiries, including through the contact points of the EJN, in order to determine which authority is competent for the recognition and execution of the freezing order.

9.   Where the authority in the executing State which receives a freezing certificate is not competent to recognise the freezing order or take the measures necessary for its execution, that authority shall immediately transmit the freezing certificate to the competent executing authority in its Member State and shall inform the issuing authority accordingly.

Article 5

Transmission of a freezing order to one or more executing States

1.   A freezing certificate shall only be transmitted pursuant to Article 4 to one executing State at any one time, unless paragraph 2 or 3 of this Article applies.

2.   Where a freezing order concerns specific items of property, the freezing certificate may be transmitted to more than one executing State at the same time where:

(a)


the issuing authority has reasonable grounds to believe that different items of property covered by the freezing order are located in different executing States; or

(b)


the freezing of a specific item of property covered by the freezing order would require action in more than one executing State.

3.   Where a freezing order concerns an amount of money, the freezing certificate may be transmitted to more than one executing State at the same time where the issuing authority considers that there is a specific need to do so, in particular where the estimated value of the property which may be frozen in the issuing State and in any one executing State is not likely to be sufficient for the freezing of the full amount covered by the freezing order.

Article 6

Standard freezing certificate

1.   In order to transmit a freezing order, the issuing authority shall complete the freezing certificate set out in Annex I, shall sign it and shall certify its content as being accurate and correct.

2.   The issuing authority shall provide the executing authority with a translation of the freezing certificate in an official language of the executing State or in any other language that the executing State will accept in accordance with paragraph 3.

3.   Any Member State may, at any time, state in a declaration submitted to the Commission that it will accept translations of freezing certificates in one or more official languages of the Union other than the official language or languages of that Member State. The Commission shall make the declarations available to all Member States and to the EJN.

Article 7

Recognition and execution of freezing orders

1.   The executing authority shall recognise a freezing order transmitted in accordance with Article 4 and shall take the measures necessary for its execution in the same way as for a domestic freezing order issued by an authority of the executing State, unless the executing authority invokes one of the grounds for non-recognition and non-execution provided for in Article 8 or one of the grounds for postponement provided for in Article 10.

2.   The executing authority shall report to the issuing authority on the execution of the freezing order, including a description of the property frozen and, where available, providing an estimate of its value. Such reporting shall be carried out using any means capable of producing a written record, without undue delay once the executing authority has been informed that the freezing order has been executed.

Article 8

Grounds for non-recognition and non-execution of freezing orders

1.   The executing authority may decide not to recognise or execute a freezing order only where:

(a)


executing the freezing order would be contrary to the principle of ne bis in idem;

(b)


there is a privilege or immunity under the law of the executing State that would prevent the freezing of the property concerned or there are rules on the determination or limitation of criminal liability that relate to the freedom of the press or the freedom of expression in other media that prevent the execution of the freezing order;

(c)


the freezing certificate is incomplete or manifestly incorrect and has not been completed following the consultation referred to in paragraph 2;

(d)


the freezing order relates to a criminal offence committed, wholly or partially, outside the territory of the issuing State and, wholly or partially, in the territory of the executing State and the conduct in connection with which the freezing order was issued does not constitute a criminal offence under the law of the executing State;

(e)


in a case falling under Article 3(2), the conduct in connection with which the freezing order was issued does not constitute a criminal offence under the law of the executing State; however, in cases that involve taxes or duties or customs and exchange regulations, the recognition or execution of the freezing order shall not be refused on the grounds that the law of the executing State does not impose the same kind of taxes or duties or does not provide for the same type of rules as regards taxes and duties or the same type of customs and exchange regulations as the law of the issuing State;

(f)


in exceptional situations, there are substantial grounds to believe, on the basis of specific and objective evidence, that the execution of the freezing order would, in the particular circumstances of the case, entail a manifest breach of a relevant fundamental right as set out in the Charter, in particular the right to an effective remedy, the right to a fair trial or the right of defence.

2.   In any of the cases referred to in paragraph 1, before deciding not to recognise or execute the freezing order, whether wholly or partially, the executing authority shall consult the issuing authority by any appropriate means and where appropriate, shall request the issuing authority to supply any necessary information without delay.

3.   Any decision not to recognise or execute the freezing order shall be taken without delay and notified immediately to the issuing authority by any means capable of producing a written record.

4.   Where the executing authority has recognised a freezing order, but it becomes aware, during the execution thereof, that one of the grounds for non-recognition or non-execution applies, it shall immediately contact the issuing authority by any appropriate means in order to discuss the appropriate measures to take. On that basis, the issuing authority may decide to withdraw the freezing order. If, following such discussions, no solution has been reached, the executing authority may decide to stop the execution of the freezing order.

Article 9

Time limits for recognition and execution of freezing orders

1.   The executing authority shall take the decision on the recognition and execution of the freezing order and execute that order without delay and with the same speed and priority as for a similar domestic case after the executing authority has received the freezing certificate.

2.   Where the issuing authority has indicated in the freezing certificate that the execution of the freezing order is to be carried out on a specific date, the executing authority shall take as full account as possible thereof. Where the issuing authority has indicated that coordination is needed between the Member States involved, the executing authority and the issuing authority shall coordinate with each other in order to agree on the date of execution of the freezing order. Where no agreement can be reached, the executing authority shall decide on the date of execution of the freezing order, taking as full account as possible of the interests of the issuing authority.

3.   Without prejudice to paragraph 5, where the issuing authority has stated in the freezing certificate that immediate freezing is necessary since there are legitimate grounds to believe that the property in question will imminently be removed or destroyed, or in view of any investigative or procedural needs in the issuing State, the executing authority shall decide on the recognition of the freezing order no later than 48 hours after it has been received by the executing authority. No later than 48 hours after such a decision has been taken, the executing authority shall take the concrete measures necessary to execute the order.

4.   The executing authority shall communicate, without delay and by any means capable of producing a written record, the decision on the recognition and execution of the freezing order to the issuing authority.

5.   Where it is not possible, in a specific case, to meet the time limits set out in paragraph 3, the executing authority shall immediately inform the issuing authority by any means, giving the reasons for which it was not possible to meet those time limits, and shall consult with the issuing authority on an appropriate schedule for the recognition or the execution of the freezing order.

6.   The expiry of the time limits set out in paragraph 3 shall not relieve the executing authority of its obligation to take a decision on the recognition and execution of the freezing order, and to execute that order, without delay.

Article 10

Postponement of the execution of freezing orders

1.   The executing authority may postpone the execution of a freezing order transmitted in accordance with Article 4 where:

(a)


its execution might damage an ongoing criminal investigation, in which case the execution of the freezing order may be postponed until such time as the executing authority considers reasonable;

(b)


the property is already the subject of an existing freezing order, in which case the execution of the freezing order may be postponed until that existing order is withdrawn; or

(c)


the property is already subject to an existing order issued in the course of other proceedings in the executing State, in which case the execution of the freezing order may be postponed until that existing order is withdrawn; however, this point shall only apply where the existing order would have priority, under national law, over subsequent national freezing orders in criminal matters.

2.   The executing authority shall, immediately and by any means capable of producing a written record, report to the issuing authority on the postponement of the execution of the freezing order, specifying the grounds for the postponement and, where possible, the expected duration of the postponement.

3.   As soon as the grounds for postponement have ceased to exist, the executing authority shall immediately take the measures necessary for the execution of the freezing order and inform the issuing authority thereof by any means capable of producing a written record.

Article 11

Confidentiality

1.   During the execution of a freezing order, the issuing authority and the executing authority shall take due account of the confidentiality of the investigation in the context of which the freezing order was issued.

2.   Except to the extent necessary to execute the freezing order, the executing authority shall guarantee the confidentiality of the facts and substance of the freezing order in accordance with its national law. Without prejudice to paragraph 3 of this Article, as soon as the freezing order has been executed, the executing authority shall inform the affected persons thereof in accordance with Article 32.

3.   To protect ongoing investigations, the issuing authority may request the executing authority to postpone informing affected persons of the execution of the freezing order under Article 32. As soon as it is no longer necessary to postpone informing affected persons in order to protect ongoing investigations, the issuing authority shall inform the executing authority accordingly so that the executing authority can inform the affected persons of the execution of the freezing order in accordance with Article 32.

4.   If the executing authority cannot comply with the confidentiality obligations under this Article, it shall notify the issuing authority immediately and, where possible, prior to the execution of the freezing order.

Article 12

Duration of freezing orders

1.   The property subject to a freezing order shall remain frozen in the executing State until the competent authority of that state has responded definitively to a confiscation order transmitted in accordance with Article 14 or until the issuing authority has informed the executing authority of any decision or measure that renders the order unenforceable or causes it to be withdrawn in accordance with Article 27(1).

2.   The executing authority may, taking into account the circumstances of the case, make a reasoned request to the issuing authority to limit the period for which the property is to be frozen. Such a request, including any relevant supporting information, shall be transmitted by any means capable of producing a written record under conditions that allow the issuing authority to establish the authenticity of the request. When examining such a request, the issuing authority shall take all interests into account, including those of the executing authority. The issuing authority shall respond to the request as soon as possible. If the issuing authority does not agree to the limitation, it shall inform the executing authority of the reasons thereof. In such a case, the property shall remain frozen in accordance with paragraph 1. If the issuing authority does not respond within six weeks of receiving the request, the executing authority shall no longer be obliged to execute the freezing order.

Article 13

Impossibility to execute a freezing order

1.   Where the executing authority considers that it is impossible to execute a freezing order, it shall notify the issuing authority thereof without delay.

2.   Before notifying the issuing authority in accordance with paragraph 1, the executing authority, where appropriate, shall consult with the issuing authority.

3.   The non-execution of a freezing order under this Article may only be justified where the property:

(a)


has already been confiscated;

(b)


has disappeared;

(c)


has been destroyed;

(d)


cannot be found in the location indicated on the freezing certificate; or

(e)


cannot be found because its location has not been indicated in a sufficiently precise manner, despite the consultations referred to in paragraph 2.

4.   As regards the situations under points (b), (d) and (e) of paragraph 3, where the executing authority subsequently obtains information that allows it to locate the property, the executing authority may execute the freezing order without a new freezing certificate having to be transmitted, provided that, prior to executing the freezing order, the executing authority has verified with the issuing authority that the freezing order is still valid.

5.   Notwithstanding paragraph 3, where the issuing authority has indicated that property of equivalent value could be frozen, the executing authority shall not be required to execute the freezing order where one of the circumstances set out in paragraph 3 exists and there is no property of equivalent value that can be frozen.

CHAPTER III

TRANSMISSION, RECOGNITION AND EXECUTION OF CONFISCATION ORDERS

Article 14

Transmission of confiscation orders

1.   A confiscation order shall be transmitted by means of a confiscation certificate. The issuing authority shall transmit the confiscation certificate provided for in Article 17 directly to the executing authority or, where applicable, to the central authority referred to in Article 24(2), by any means capable of producing a written record under conditions that allow the executing authority to establish the authenticity of the confiscation certificate.

2.   Member States may make a declaration stating that, when a confiscation certificate is transmitted to them with a view to the recognition and execution of a confiscation order, the issuing authority is to transmit the original confiscation order or a certified copy thereof together with the confiscation certificate. However, only the confiscation certificate has to be translated, in accordance with Article 17(2).

3.   Member States may make the declaration referred to in paragraph 2 prior to the date of application of this Regulation or at a later date. Member States may withdraw such a declaration at any time. Member States shall inform the Commission when they make or withdraw such a declaration. The Commission shall make such information available to all Member States and to the EJN.

4.   As regards a confiscation order concerning an amount of money, where the issuing authority has reasonable grounds to believe that the person against whom the confiscation order was issued has property or income in a Member State, it shall transmit the confiscation certificate to that Member State.

5.   As regards a confiscation order concerning specific items of property, where the issuing authority has reasonable grounds to believe that such items are located in a Member State, it shall transmit the confiscation certificate to that Member State.

6.   The issuing authority shall inform the executing authority if it is aware of any affected persons. The issuing authority shall also, upon request, provide the executing authority with any information relevant to any claim that such affected persons may have in relation to the property, including any information identifying those persons.

7.   Where, despite the information having been made available in accordance with Article 24(3), the competent executing authority is unknown to the issuing authority, the issuing authority shall make all necessary inquiries, including through the contact points of the EJN, in order to determine which authority is competent for the recognition and execution of the confiscation order.

8.   Where the authority in the executing State which receives a confiscation certificate is not competent to recognise the confiscation order or to take the measures necessary for its execution, that authority shall immediately transmit the confiscation certificate to the competent executing authority in its Member State and shall inform the issuing authority accordingly.

Article 15

Transmission of a confiscation order to one or more executing States

1.   A confiscation certificate shall only be transmitted, pursuant to Article 14, to one executing State at any one time, unless paragraph 2 or 3 of this Article applies.

2.   Where a confiscation order concerns specific items of property, the confiscation certificate may be transmitted to more than one executing State at the same time where:

(a)


the issuing authority has reasonable grounds to believe that different items of property covered by the confiscation order are located in different executing States; or

(b)


the confiscation of a specific item of property covered by the confiscation order would require action in more than one executing State.

3.   Where a confiscation order concerns an amount of money, the confiscation certificate may be transmitted to more than one executing State at the same time where the issuing authority considers that there is a specific need to do so, in particular where:

(a)


the property concerned has not been frozen under this Regulation; or

(b)


the estimated value of the property which may be confiscated in the issuing State and in any one executing State is not likely to be sufficient for the confiscation of the full amount covered by the confiscation order.

Article 16

Consequences of transmission of confiscation orders

1.   The transmission of a confiscation order, in accordance with Articles 14 and 15, shall not restrict the right of the issuing State to execute the order.

2.   The total amount obtained from the execution of a confiscation order concerning an amount of money shall not exceed the maximum amount specified in that order, regardless of whether that order was transmitted to one or to several executing States.

3.   The issuing authority shall immediately inform the executing authority by any means capable of producing a written record where:

(a)


it considers that there is a risk that confiscation in excess of the maximum amount may occur, in particular on the basis of information received from the executing authority pursuant to point (b) of Article 21(1);

(b)


all or a part of the confiscation order has been executed in the issuing State or in a different executing State, in which case it shall specify the amount for which the confiscation order has not yet been executed; or

(c)


after the transmission of a confiscation certificate in accordance with Article 14, an authority of the issuing State receives any sum of money which has been paid in respect of the confiscation order.

Where point (a) of the first subparagraph applies, the issuing authority shall inform the executing authority as soon as possible when the risk referred to in that point ceases to exist.

Article 17

Standard confiscation certificate

1.   In order to transmit a confiscation order, the issuing authority shall complete the confiscation certificate set out in Annex II, shall sign it and shall certify its content as being accurate and correct.

2.   The issuing authority shall provide the executing authority with a translation of the confiscation certificate in an official language of the executing State or in any other language that the executing State will accept in accordance with paragraph 3.

3.   Any Member State may, at any time, state in a declaration submitted to the Commission that it will accept translations of confiscation certificates in one or more official languages of the Union other than the official language or languages of that Member State. The Commission shall make the declarations available to all Member States and to the EJN.

Article 18

Recognition and execution of confiscation orders

1.   The executing authority shall recognise a confiscation order transmitted in accordance with Article 14 and shall take the measures necessary for its execution in the same way as for a domestic confiscation order issued by an authority of the executing State, unless the executing authority invokes one of the grounds for non-recognition and non-execution provided for in Article 19 or one of the grounds for postponement provided for in Article 21.

2.   Where a confiscation order concerns a specific item of property, the issuing authority and executing authority may, where the law of the issuing State so provides, agree that confiscation in the executing State can be carried out through the confiscation of a sum of money corresponding to the value of the property that was to be confiscated.

3.   Where a confiscation order concerns an amount of money and the executing authority is unable to obtain payment of that amount, it shall execute the confiscation order in accordance with paragraph 1 on any item of property that is available for that purpose. Where necessary, the executing authority shall convert the amount of money to be confiscated into the currency of the executing State at the daily euro exchange rate as published in the C series of the Official Journal of the European Union for the date on which the confiscation order was issued.

4.   Any part of the amount of money that is recovered pursuant to the confiscation order in any State other than the executing State shall be deducted in full from the amount to be confiscated in the executing State.

5.   Where the issuing authority has issued a confiscation order but has not issued a freezing order, the executing authority may, as part of the measures provided for in paragraph 1, decide to freeze the property concerned of its own motion in accordance with its national law with a view to subsequent execution of the confiscation order. In such a case, the executing authority shall inform the issuing authority without delay and, where possible, prior to freezing the property concerned.

6.   As soon as the execution of the confiscation order has been completed, the executing authority shall inform, by any means capable of producing a written record, the issuing authority of the results of the execution.

Article 19

Grounds for non-recognition and non-execution of confiscation orders

1.   The executing authority may decide not to recognise or execute a confiscation order only where:

(a)


executing the confiscation order would be contrary to the principle of ne bis in idem;

(b)


there is a privilege or immunity under the law of the executing State that would prevent the confiscation of the property concerned or there are rules on the determination or limitation of criminal liability that relate to the freedom of the press or the freedom of expression in other media that prevent the execution of the confiscation order;

(c)


the confiscation certificate is incomplete or manifestly incorrect and has not been completed following the consultation referred to in paragraph 2;

(d)


the confiscation order relates to a criminal offence committed, wholly or partially, outside the territory of the issuing State and, wholly or partially, in the territory of the executing State and the conduct in connection with which the confiscation order was issued does not constitute a criminal offence under the law of the executing State;

(e)


the rights of affected persons would make it impossible under the law of the executing State to execute the confiscation order, including where that impossibility is a consequence of the application of legal remedies in accordance with Article 33;

(f)


in a case falling under Article 3(2), the conduct in connection with which the confiscation order was issued does not constitute a criminal offence under the law of the executing State; however, in cases that involve taxes or duties or customs and exchange regulations, the recognition or execution of the confiscation order shall not be refused on the grounds that the law of the executing State does not impose the same kind of taxes or duties or does not provide for the same type of rules as regards taxes and duties or the same type of customs and exchange regulations as the law of the issuing State;

(g)


according to the confiscation certificate, the person against whom the confiscation order was issued did not appear in person at the trial that resulted in the confiscation order linked to a final conviction, unless the confiscation certificate states that, in accordance with further procedural requirements defined in the law of the issuing State, the person:

(i)


was summoned in person in due time and was thereby informed of the scheduled date and place of the trial that resulted in the confiscation order, or actually received, by other means, official information of the scheduled date and place of that trial in such a manner that it was established unequivocally that that person was aware of the scheduled trial, and was informed in due time that such a confiscation order could be handed down if that person did not appear at the trial;

(ii)


being aware of the scheduled trial, had given a mandate to a lawyer, who was either appointed by the person concerned or by the State, to defend that person at the trial and was actually defended by that lawyer at the trial; or

(iii)


after having been served with the confiscation order and having been expressly informed of the right to a retrial or an appeal, in which the person would have the right to participate and which would allow a re-examination of the merits of the case including an examination of fresh evidence, and which could lead to the original confiscation order being reversed, expressly stated that he or she did not contest the confiscation order, or did not request a retrial or appeal within the applicable time limits;

(h)


in exceptional situations, there are substantial grounds to believe, on the basis of specific and objective evidence, that the execution of the confiscation order would, in the particular circumstances of the case, entail a manifest breach of a relevant fundamental right as set out in the Charter, in particular the right to an effective remedy, the right to a fair trial or the right of defence.

2.   In any of the cases referred to in paragraph 1, before deciding not to recognise or execute the confiscation order, whether wholly or partially, the executing authority shall consult the issuing authority by any appropriate means and, where appropriate, shall request the issuing authority to supply any necessary information without delay.

3.   Any decision not to recognise or execute the confiscation order shall be taken without delay and notified immediately to the issuing authority by any means capable of producing a written record.

Article 20

Time limits for recognition and execution of confiscation orders

1.   The executing authority shall take the decision on the recognition and execution of the confiscation order without delay and, without prejudice to paragraph 4, no later than 45 days after the executing authority has received the confiscation certificate.

2.   The executing authority shall communicate, without delay and by any means capable of producing a written record, the decision on the recognition and execution of the confiscation order to the issuing authority.

3.   Unless grounds for postponement under Article 21 exist, the executing authority shall take the concrete measures necessary to execute the confiscation order without delay and, at least, with the same speed and priority as for a similar domestic case.

4.   Where it is not possible, in a specific case, to meet the time limit set out in paragraph 1, the executing authority shall inform the issuing authority without delay by any means, giving the reasons for which it was not possible to meet that time limit, and shall consult with the issuing authority on an appropriate schedule for the recognition and execution of the confiscation order.

5.   The expiry of the time limit set out in paragraph 1 shall not relieve the executing authority of its obligation to take a decision on the recognition and execution of the confiscation order, and to execute that order, without delay.

Article 21

Postponement of the execution of confiscation orders

1.   The executing authority may postpone the recognition or execution of a confiscation order transmitted in accordance with Article 14 where:

(a)


its execution might damage an ongoing criminal investigation, in which case the execution of the confiscation order may be postponed until such time as the executing authority considers reasonable;

(b)


as regards a confiscation order concerning an amount of money, it considers that there is a risk that the total amount obtained from the execution of that confiscation order might considerably exceed the amount specified in the confiscation order because of the simultaneous execution of the confiscation order in more than one Member State;

(c)


the property is already the subject of ongoing confiscation proceedings in the executing State; or

(d)


a legal remedy as referred to in Article 33 has been invoked.

2.   Notwithstanding Article 18(5), for as long as the execution of a confiscation order is postponed, the competent authority of the executing State shall take all the measures it would take in a similar domestic case to prevent the property from no longer being available for the purpose of the execution of the confiscation order.

3.   The executing authority shall, without delay and by any means capable of producing a written record, report to the issuing authority on the postponement of the execution of the confiscation order, specifying the grounds for the postponement and, where possible, the expected duration of the postponement.

4.   As soon as the grounds for postponement have ceased to exist, the executing authority shall take, without delay, the measures necessary for the execution of the confiscation order and inform the issuing authority thereof by any means capable of producing a written record.

Article 22

Impossibility to execute a confiscation order

1.   Where the executing authority considers that it is impossible to execute a confiscation order, it shall notify the issuing authority thereof without delay.

2.   Before notifying the issuing authority in accordance with paragraph 1, the executing authority, where appropriate, shall consult with the issuing authority, taking into account also the possibilities provided for under Article 18(2) or (3).

3.   The non-execution of a confiscation order under this Article may only be justified where the property:

(a)


has already been confiscated;

(b)


has disappeared;

(c)


has been destroyed;

(d)


cannot be found in the location indicated on the confiscation certificate; or

(e)


cannot be found because its location has not been indicated in a sufficiently precise manner, despite the consultations referred to in paragraph 2.

4.   As regards the situations under points (b), (d) and (e) of paragraph 3, where the executing authority subsequently obtains information that allows it to locate the property, the executing authority may execute the confiscation order without a new confiscation certificate having to be transmitted, provided that, prior to executing the confiscation order, the executing authority has verified with the issuing authority that the confiscation order is still valid.

5.   Notwithstanding paragraph 3, where the issuing authority has indicated that property of equivalent value could be confiscated, the executing authority shall not be required to execute the confiscation order where one of the circumstances set out in paragraph 3 exists and there is no property of equivalent value that can be confiscated.

CHAPTER IV

GENERAL PROVISIONS

2.   All communications, including those intended to deal with difficulties concerning the transmission or authentication of any document needed for the execution of the freezing order or confiscation order, shall be made directly between the issuing authority and the executing authority and, where a Member State has designated a central authority in accordance with Article 24(2), shall be made, where appropriate, with the involvement of that central authority.

Article 26

Multiple orders

1.   If the executing authority receives two or more freezing orders or confiscation orders from different Member States issued against the same person and that person does not have sufficient property in the executing State to satisfy all of the orders, or if the executing authority receives two or more freezing orders or confiscation orders in respect of the same specific item of property, the executing authority shall decide which of the orders to execute in accordance with the law of the executing State, without prejudice to the possibility of postponing the execution of a confiscation order in accordance with Article 21.

The executing State shall not be required to sell or return specific items covered by a confiscation order, where those items constitute cultural objects, as defined in point (1) of Article 2 of Directive 2014/60/EU of the European Parliament and of the Council (18). This Regulation shall not affect the obligation to return cultural objects under that Directive.

Article 29

Restitution of frozen property to the victim

1.   Where the issuing authority or another competent authority of the issuing State has issued a decision, in accordance with its national law, to restitute frozen property to the victim, the issuing authority shall include information on that decision in the freezing certificate or communicate information on that decision to the executing authority at a later stage.

2.   Where the executing authority has been informed of a decision to restitute frozen property to the victim as referred to in paragraph 1, it shall take the necessary measures to ensure that, where the property concerned has been frozen, that property is restituted as soon as possible to the victim, in accordance with the procedural rules of the executing State, where necessary via the issuing State, provided that:

(a)


the victim's title to the property is not contested;

(b)


the property is not required as evidence in criminal proceedings in the executing State; and

(c)


the rights of affected persons are not prejudiced.

The executing authority shall inform the issuing authority where property is transferred directly to the victim.

3.   Where the executing authority is not satisfied that the conditions of paragraph 2 have been met, it shall consult with the issuing authority without delay and by any appropriate means in order to find a solution.

Article 30

Disposal of confiscated property or money obtained after selling such property

1.   Where the issuing authority or another competent authority of the issuing State has issued a decision, in accordance with its national law, either to restitute confiscated property to the victim or to compensate the victim, the issuing authority shall include information on that decision in the confiscation certificate or communicate, at a later stage, information on that decision to the executing authority.

2.   Where the executing authority has been informed of a decision to restitute confiscated property to the victim as referred to in paragraph 1, it shall take the necessary measures to ensure that, where the property concerned has been confiscated, that property is restituted as soon as possible to the victim, where necessary via the issuing State. The executing authority shall inform the issuing authority where property is transferred directly to the victim.

3.   Where it is not possible for the executing authority to restitute the property to the victim in accordance with paragraph 2, but money has been obtained as a result of the execution of a confiscation order in relation to that property, the corresponding sum shall be transferred to the victim for the purposes of restitution, where necessary via the issuing State. The executing authority shall inform the issuing authority where money is transferred directly to the victim. Any remaining property shall be disposed of in accordance with paragraph 7.

4.   Where the executing authority has been informed of a decision to compensate the victim as referred to in paragraph 1, and money has been obtained as a result of the execution of a confiscation order, the corresponding sum, in so far as it does not exceed the amount indicated in the certificate, shall be transferred to the victim for the purposes of compensation, where necessary via the issuing State. The executing authority shall inform the issuing authority where money is transferred directly to the victim. Any remaining property shall be disposed of in accordance with paragraph 7.

5.   Where proceedings to restitute property to, or compensate, the victim are pending in the issuing State, the issuing authority shall inform the executing authority accordingly. The executing State shall refrain from disposing of the confiscated property until the information on the decision to restitute property to, or compensate, the victim has been communicated to the executing authority, even in cases where the confiscation order has already been executed.

6.   Without prejudice to paragraphs 1 to 5, property other than money that has been obtained as a result of the execution of the confiscation order shall be disposed of in accordance with the following rules:

(a)


the property may be sold, in which case the proceeds of the sale are to be disposed of in accordance with paragraph 7;

(b)


the property may be transferred to the issuing State provided that, where the confiscation order covers an amount of money, the issuing authority has given its consent to the transfer of property to the issuing State;

subject to point (d), if it is not possible to apply point (a) or (b), the property may be disposed of in another way in accordance with the law of the executing State; or

(a)


if the amount obtained from the execution of the confiscation order is equal to or less than EUR 10 000, the amount shall accrue to the executing State; or

(b)


if the amount obtained from the execution of the confiscation order is more than EUR 10 000, 50 % of the amount shall be transferred by the executing State to the issuing State.

Article 31

Costs

1.   Each Member State shall bear its own costs resulting from the application of this Regulation, without prejudice to the provisions relating to the disposal of confiscated property set out in Article 28.

2.   The executing authority may submit a proposal to the issuing authority that the costs be shared where it appears, either before or after the execution of a freezing order or confiscation order, that the execution of the order would entail large or exceptional costs.

Such proposals shall be accompanied by a detailed breakdown of the costs incurred by the executing authority. Following such a proposal the issuing authority and the executing authority shall consult with each other. Where appropriate, Eurojust may facilitate such consultations.

The consultations, or at least the result thereof, shall be recorded by any means capable of producing a written record.

Article 32

Obligation to inform affected persons

1.   Without prejudice to Article 11, following the execution of a freezing order or following the decision to recognise and execute a confiscation order, the executing authority shall inform, to the extent possible, the affected persons known to it of such execution and of such decision without delay, in accordance with procedures under its national law.

2.   The information to be provided in accordance with paragraph 1 shall specify the name of the issuing authority and the legal remedies available under the law of the executing State. The information shall also specify, at least in a brief manner, the reasons for the order.

3.   Where appropriate, the executing authority may ask the issuing authority for assistance in carrying out the tasks referred to in paragraph 1.

The right to a legal remedy shall be invoked before a court in the executing State in accordance with its law. As regards confiscation orders, the invocation of a legal remedy may have suspensive effect where the law of the executing State so provides.

2.   The substantive reasons for issuing the freezing order or confiscation order shall not be challenged before a court in the executing State.

3.   The competent authority of the issuing State shall be informed of any legal remedy invoked in accordance with paragraph 1.

Article 34

Reimbursement

1.   Where the executing State is liable under its law for damage to an affected person resulting from the execution of a freezing order transmitted to it pursuant to Article 4 or confiscation order transmitted to it pursuant to Article 14, the issuing State shall reimburse the executing State for any damages paid to the affected person. However, where the issuing State can demonstrate to the executing State that the damage, or any part thereof, was exclusively due to the conduct of the executing State, the issuing and executing States shall agree between themselves on the amount to be reimbursed.

2.   Paragraph 1 is without prejudice to the law of the Member States on claims by natural or legal persons for compensation for damage.

CHAPTER V
